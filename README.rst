-----------------------------------------------
Apply configuration from cloud metadata (JSON)
-----------------------------------------------

What does it do?
================

It turns metadata from one or more JSON files like this::

    {"keystone": {"database": {"host": "127.0.0.1", "user": "keystone", "password": "foobar"}}}

into service config files like this::

    [sql]
    connection = mysql://keystone:foobar@127.0.0.1/keystone
    ...other settings...

Usage
=====

Just pass it the path to a directory tree of templates::

    sudo os-apply-config -t /home/me/my_templates

By default it will read config files according to the contents of
the file `/var/lib/os-collect-config/os_config_files.json`. In
order to remain backward compatible it will also fall back to
/var/run/os-collect-config/os_config_files.json, but the fallback
path is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. The main
path can be changed with the command line switch `--os-config-files`,
or the environment variable `OS_CONFIG_FILES_PATH`. The list can
also be overridden with the environment variable `OS_CONFIG_FILES`.
If overriding with `OS_CONFIG_FILES`, the paths are expected to be colon,
":", separated. Each json file referred to must have a mapping as their
root structure. Keys in files mentioned later in the list will override
keys in earlier files from this list. For example::

    OS_CONFIG_FILES=/tmp/ec2.json:/tmp/cfn.json os-apply-config

This will read `ec2.json` and `cfn.json`, and if they have any
overlapping keys, the value from `cfn.json` will be used. That will
populate the tree for any templates found in the template path. See
https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/os-collect-config for a
program that will automatically collect data and populate this list.

You can also override `OS_CONFIG_FILES` with the `--metadata` command
line option, specifying it multiple times instead of colon separating
the list.

`os-apply-config` will also always try to read metadata in the old
legacy paths first to populate the tree. These paths can be changed
with `--fallback-metadata`.

Templates
=========

The template directory structure should mimic a root filesystem, and
contain templates for only those files you want configured. For
example::

   ~/my_templates$ tree
   .
   +-- etc
       +-- keystone
       |    +-- keystone.conf
       +-- mysql
             +-- mysql.conf

An example tree can be found `here <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/tripleo-image-elements/tree/elements/keystone/os-apply-config>`_.

If a template is executable it will be treated as an *executable
template*.  Otherwise, it will be treated as a *mustache template*.

Mustache Templates
------------------

If you don't need any logic, just some string substitution, use a
mustache template.

Metadata settings are accessed with dot ('.') notation::

  [sql]
  connection = mysql://{{keystone.database.user}}:{{keystone.database.password}}@{{keystone.database.host}}/keystone

Executable Templates
--------------------

Configuration requiring logic is expressed in executable templates.

An executable template is a script which accepts configuration as a
JSON string on standard in, and writes a config file to standard out.

The script should exit non-zero if it encounters a problem, so that
os-apply-config knows what's up.

The output of the script will be written to the path corresponding to
the executable template's path in the template tree::

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  require 'json'
  params = JSON.parse STDIN.read
  puts "connection = mysql://#{c['keystone']['database']['user']}:#{c['keystone']['database']['password']}@#{c['keystone']['database']['host']}/keystone"

You could even embed mustache in a heredoc, and use that::

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  require 'json'
  require 'mustache'
  params = JSON.parse STDIN.read

  template = <<-eos
  [sql]
  connection = mysql://{{keystone.database.user}}:{{keystone.database.password}}@{{keystone.database.host}}/keystone

  [log]
  ...
  eos

  # tweak params here...

  puts Mustache.render(template, params)


Quick Start
===========
::

   # install it
   sudo pip install -U git+git://git.openstack.org/openstack/os-apply-config.git

   # grab example templates
   git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack/tripleo-image-elements /tmp/config

   # run it
   os-apply-config -t /tmp/config/elements/nova/os-apply-config/ -m /tmp/config/elements/seed-stack-config/config.json -o /tmp/config_output
